No one is perfect - that’s why pencils have erasers.
You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
It always seems impossible until it is done.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
Have courage and be kind.
You define your own life. Don’t let other people write your script.
Spread love everywhere you go.
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
Believe you can and you’re halfway there.
In a gentle way, you can shake the world.
